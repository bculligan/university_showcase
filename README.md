# University Showcase

To protect against the use of my university work, most of it is kept hidden. This repository serves to display the reports from some of the larger projects which can safely be viewed by the public.  

Excluding the reports in this repository, a subset of other notable projects from this period include:
- Slice 'n Dice [Delphi (Pascal) | MSAccess (SQL)]: a desktop application recipe manager which can keep stock of your kitchen inventory to help present recipes that can be made with what is currently available in the kitchen. Includes a shopping list, access to online shopping, or the shopping list can be printed or otherwise shared for physical trips to the store. Beyond this, you can plan your meals in Slice 'n Dice and track previous meals you have eaten. Together, this can provide deep analytics into your eating habits. Slice 'n Dice has a basic analytics tab in which you can compare your true dietary in-take (based on the tracked meals) to the dietary goals you have set for yourself.
- High Performance Computing (HPC) Analysis [C | OpenMP | MPI]: Analysed performance comparisons of alternative solutions (serial, OpenMP, MPI, and hybrid OpenMP and MPI) when applying a median filter to a directory of colour images.
- River Flow Simulation [Java]: Uses the Java fork/join framework for concurrent simulation of water flowing on an inputted terrain file. The simulation is displayed in a Swing GUI.
- Graphics OBJ Renderer [C++ | OpenGL]: Load OBJ files and transform it (and its children) in this renderer with a lighting model and texture loading.
- Nudge: A new venture plan to help alleviate the economic turmoil of the tourism industry due to COVID-19.
- Statistical Analysis [R]: A collection of problems solved in R focusing on statistical topics such as regression, time series analysis, generalised linear models, Bayesian analysis, and machine learning (H2O and RPart) for neural networks and trees.
